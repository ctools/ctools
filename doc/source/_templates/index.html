<p>{%trans%} ctools is a software package for the scientific analysis of
astronomical gamma-ray data. The package comprises an extensive set of tools
for the analysis of data from existing and future Cherenkov telescopes,
including H.E.S.S., VERITAS, MAGIC and CTA. ctools supports also the analysis
of data from CGRO/COMPTEL, Fermi/LAT and INTEGRAL/SPI, enabling the exploration
of the full gamma-ray energy band, spanning from hundreds of keV to hundreds of
TeV. {%endtrans%}</p>

<p>{%trans%} The ctools philosophy inherited from ftools consists of providing
building blocks that perform well-defined science data analysis tasks, including
observation and event selection, binning, sky map creation, source detection,
model fitting, spectra, phase curve and light curve generation, and observation
simulations. The building blocks are then combined by the user to create flexible
analysis workflows that can fit the needs of any scientist. {%endtrans%}</p>

<p>{%trans%} ctools can be used as command-line executables alike ftools to carry
out simple analyses even for users without any programming skills. Furthermore,
the tools are accessible through dedicated Python modules providing an alternative
user interface to the software, as well as the possibility to provide tutorials
in the form of Jupyter notebooks. Shell or Python scripts can be used by more
advanced users to build analysis pipelines to any degrees of complexity.

<p>{%trans%} ctools are based on <a href="http://cta.irap.omp.eu/gammalib">GammaLib</a>,
a versatile toolbox for the scientific analysis of astronomical gamma-ray data.

<p>{%trans%} ctools are developed by a community of enthousiastic gamma-ray
astronomers with support from engineers. The lead institute is
