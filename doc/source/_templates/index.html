<p>{%trans%} ctools is a software package developed for the scientific
analysis of Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) data. Analysis of data from
existing Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (such as H.E.S.S., MAGIC or
VERITAS) is also supported, provided that the data and response functions
are available in the format defined for CTA. {%endtrans%}</p>

<p>{%trans%} ctools comprises a set of ftools-like binary executables with
a command-line interface allowing for interactive step-wise data analysis.
ctools includes also a Python module allowing to control all executables. 
Creation of shell or Python scripts and pipelines is supported.
ctools provides cscripts, which are Python scripts complementing the binary
executables. Extensions of the ctools package by user defined binary 
executables or Python scripts is supported. {%endtrans%}</p>

<p>{%trans%} ctools are based on <a href="http://cta.irap.omp.eu/gammalib">GammaLib</a>,
a versatile toolbox for the high-level analysis of astronomical gamma-ray data.
Besides CTA, GammaLib supports also the analysis of Fermi/LAT and COMPTEL data, 
and extensions to support further gamma-ray instruments are planned.
An interface to virtual observatory ressources is also in preparation.
By making use of the GammaLib multi-instrument capabilities, ctools
supports the joint analysis of CTA (or any IACT providing data in the
CTA format), Fermi/LAT and COMPTEL data. {%endtrans%}</p>

<p>{%trans%} ctools are developed by a team of enthousiastic gamma-ray
astronomers with support from engineers. We regularily organise
<a href=https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/ctools/wiki/Coding_sprints>coding sprints</a>
where key developers but also newcomers meet to discuss the developments 
and next steps, and advance with the coding of the software. {%endtrans%}</p>
