<p>{%trans%} ctools is a software package developed for the scientific
analysis of Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) data, as well as data from
existing Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (such as H.E.S.S., MAGIC or VERITAS).
{%endtrans%}</p>

<p>{%trans%} ctools comprises a set of ftools-like binary executables and
Python scripts with a command-line interface allowing for interactive step-wise
data analysis. ctools includes also Python modules to control all tools and
scripts from within Python. Creation of shell or Python scripts and pipelines
is supported as well. {%endtrans%}</p>

<p>{%trans%} ctools are based on <a href="http://cta.irap.omp.eu/gammalib">GammaLib</a>,
a versatile toolbox for the scientific analysis of astronomical gamma-ray data.
Besides CTA, GammaLib supports also the analysis of Fermi/LAT and COMPTEL data, 
and extensions to support further gamma-ray instruments are planned. An
interface to virtual observatory ressources does also exist. By making use of
the GammaLib multi-instrument capabilities, ctools supports the joint analysis
of CTA, H.E.S.S., MAGIC, VERITAS, Fermi/LAT, INTEGRAL/SPI and COMPTEL data.
{%endtrans%}</p>

<p>{%trans%} ctools are developed by a team of enthousiastic gamma-ray
astronomers with support from engineers. We regularily organise
<a href=https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/ctools/wiki/Coding_sprints>coding sprints</a>
where key developers but also newcomers meet to discuss the developments 
and next steps, and advance with the coding of the software. {%endtrans%}</p>
