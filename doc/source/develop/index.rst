Developer documentation
=======================

ctools is an open source projet and you are highly welcome to contribute 
to the development.
Contributions can come in any areas: writing C++ code, contributing Python 
scripts, writing documentation, testing code, etc.

We manage the ctools source code using `GitLab <https://cta-gitlab.irap.omp.eu>`_.
We also have a `Redmine <https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/ctools/>`_
development platform to track issues.
We use a continuous integration system based on
`Jenkins <https://cta-jenkins.irap.omp.eu>`_
and we monitor our code quality with
`SonarQube <https://cta-sonar.irap.omp.eu/overview?id=3055>`_.

You may also want to get in the ctools information flow by subscribing to 
the ctools@irap.omp.eu mailing list.
To subscribe simply send an e-mail to ctools-subscribe@irap.omp.eu.

We are organising regular
`Coding sprints <https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/ctools/wiki/Coding_sprints>`_
to allow newcomers to get familiar with the code base and the coding
practices.
You are highly invited to join one of the next coding sprints.

You can also follow `@ctools_software <https://twitter.com/ctools_software>`_ on
twitter to get informed about new ctools releases.
