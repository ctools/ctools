Getting Help
============

If you need help you should first check the
:ref:`Frequently Asked Questions <faq>` and the list of
:ref:`Known Issues <issues>`.
In case that you do not find an answer to your question you may post your 
question on the ctools@irap.omp.eu mailing list.
To subscribe to this list you simply need to send an e-mail to
ctools-subscribe@irap.omp.eu (content is irrelevant).

You can also use the `Redmine <https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/ctools>`_
system that we use for the ctools software development management to ask for 
support, report a bug, or request a new feature. To use the system you 
will first need to
`register <https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/account/register>`_.

Once registered, you can sign-in and ask for support by creating a
`support issue <https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/ctools/issues/new>`_.
Specify ``Support`` as Tracker, choose a short and meaningful subject,
and add an exhaustive description of your request.

If you find a bug you should first check the 
`list of bugs <https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/ctools/issues?utf8=?&set_filter=1&f%5B%5D=status_id&op%5Bstatus_id%5D=*&f%5B%5D=tracker_id&op%5Btracker_id%5D=%3D&v%5Btracker_id%5D%5B%5D=1&f%5B%5D=&c%5B%5D=tracker&c%5B%5D=status&c%5B%5D=priority&c%5B%5D=subject&c%5B%5D=assigned_to&c%5B%5D=updated_on&c%5B%5D=fixed_version&c%5B%5D=done_ratio&group_by=>`_
to see whether your bug is already known. If the bug is known, you may edit
the issue and add some information (e.g. a log file, screen shot, etc.).
If the bug is not yet known, please create a
`bug issue <https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/ctools/issues/new>`_.
Specify ``Bug`` as Tracker, provide a short and meaningful subject, and add
an exhaustive description of the bug. Include the ctools software version, 
your operating system, and the conditions under which the bug occurred. Ideally
you should provide all files and the command sequence (or a script) that 
will allow us to reproduce the bug.

If you would like to suggest some enhancements to ctools you should create 
a
`feature issue <https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/ctools/issues/new>`_.
Specify ``Feature`` as Tracker, choose a short and meaningful subject,
and add an exhaustive description of your feature request.
Also explain the motivation for your request and provide some hint on how 
urgently you need the new feature.

You may click on ``Watch`` in the top-right corner of the issue page to make sure
that you will receive an e-mail notification when the issue is updated.
