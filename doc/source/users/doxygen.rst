Interface Manual
================

ctools is comprised of a C++ library that can be accessed from C++ code through
its Application Programming Interface (API).
It can also be accessed from Python through a dedicated module that is generated
using the
`Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG) <http://www.swig.org>`_.
ctools comprises also a number of Python scripts, called cscripts, that can be
accessed through a dedicated Python module.
The cscripts are not accessible from C++.

The documentation of all ctools and cscripts programming interfaces is generated
using `Doxygen <https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>`_. Also the GammaLib
programming interfaces are documented via
`Doxygen <https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>`_.
Both APIs are accessible through the links below:

* `ctools interface manual <../doxygen/index.html>`_
* `GammaLib interface manual <http://cta.irap.omp.eu/gammalib/doxygen/index.html>`_
