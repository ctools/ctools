csiactcopy
===========

Copies IACT data from one location to another


Synopsis
--------

This script allows to download IACT data from a remote machine. The remote file system
has to be mounted before running the script. For mounting, e.g. sshfs can be used:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sshfs user@remote.server.com:/path/to/remote/fits /path/to/mountpoint/

The script can optionally take an ASCII file with a list of observation IDs as input.
In this way the user can copy only a specific subset of the data. Index files and data
structure is updated accordingly by the script. 

In case the copying procedure failed due to e.g. a broken connection, the script can be executed
again using the parameter ``clobber=no``. Thus files that were already copied don't get
recopied and overwritten which saves time.

In order to monitor the progress on the screen, the script can be executed with the
hidden parameter ``debug=yes``
