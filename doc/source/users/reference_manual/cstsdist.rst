========

Generates the TS distribution for a given source.


Synopsis
--------

This script generates the Test Statistics (TS) distribution for a given 
source by repeatedly computing the TS value for ``ntrials`` simulated data 
sets. The Test Statistics is defined as twice the log-likelihood difference
that is obtained when fitting simulated data with and without a given
source model component.

This script either performs an unbinned or a binned simulation, stacked 
analysis is not yet supported.

cstsdist will create an ASCII file in comma-separated value (CSV) format,
containing one row per TS computation. The first row is a header row providing
the column names. The following rows give the TS value, the log-likelihood 
values of the fit with or without the source, the number of observed and 
fitted events, as well as the values and errors for all fitted parameters.

From the output file, TS distribution plots can be generated using for
example the ``show_ts_distribution.py`` script in the examples folder. The
script require matplotlib for plotting.

Standard parameters
-------------------

``(chatter = 2) [integer]``
    Verbosity of the executable:
     ``chatter = 0``: no information will be logged
