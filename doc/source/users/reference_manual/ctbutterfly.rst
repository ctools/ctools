===========

Computes butterfly diagram for a given spectral model.


Synopsis
--------

This tool calculates a butterfly diagram for a specific source according to 
its spectral model. The butterfly diagram is the envelope of all spectral
models that are within a given confidence limit compatible with the data.
The default method used for the calculation is Gaussian error propagation
using the covariance matrix from a maximum likelihood fit. By default a
confidence level of 68% is used, but the level can be adjusted using the
hidden ``confidence`` parameter. For power law models, an alternative
calculation method can be specified by setting the hidden parameter
``method=ENVELOPE``. By using this method, the envelope is computed by
evaluating for each energy the minimum and maximum intensity of all power
law models that fall within the error ellipse of the prefactor and index
parameters. The error ellipse is derived from the covariance matrix of a
maximum likelihood fit.

ctbutterfly assumes that the input model (parameter ``inmodel``) has been 
adjusted using :doc:`ctlike` to the data, but if this is not the case you 
can request a maximum likelihood fit by setting the hidden parameter ``fit=yes``.

ctbutterfly writes the butterfly diagram into an ASCII file with 4 columns 
separated by a whitespace. Each row in the result file corresponds to a specific
energy. The meaning of the columns are:

* Energy in MeV
* Fitted intensity for that energy in ph/cm2/s/MeV
* Minimum intensity for that energy in ph/cm2/s/MeV
* Maximum intensity for that energy in ph/cm2/s/MeV

The butterfly diagram can be displayed using the ``show_butterfly.py`` script
in the example folder.
