Generate exposure cube for a stacked analysis.


Synopsis
--------

This tool generates an exposure cube for a stacked analysis. An exposure
cube is a 3-dimensional cube spanned by Right Ascension or Galactic longitude,
Declination or Galactic latitude, and energy, that gives the exposure 
as function of true sky direction and energy. The energy binning of the cube 
may be either linear, logarithmic, or custom defined using an input file.

ctexpcube requires on input the event list or observation definition file 
that has been used in the generation of the counts cube using :doc:`ctbin`.

The binning of an exposure cube does not need to correspond to the binning
of a counts cube, as exposure values will in any case be determined by linear
interpolation. For the user's convenience, however, the counts cube can be
specified as ``incube`` parameter which will instruct ctexpcube to extract
the exposure cube definition (such as sky coordinates and projection, number
of pixels, pixel scale, energy binning) from the counts cube. Note, however,
that the exposure cube is defined in true sky coordinates and energy while
the counts cube is defined in measured sky coordinates and energy. Consequently,
the sky area and energy range covered by the exposure cube should be slightly
larger than that of the counts cube to accommodate for spill over of events
due to the point spread function and energy dispersion. By computing the
exposure cube on the same grid as the counts cube, the spill over of events
from sources at the edge of cube will not be handled correctly.

Note that there should at least be 25 bins per energy decade in the exposure
cube to assure that the energy dependence of the exposure is sufficiently
well sampled (in particular at low energies).

ctexpcube generates an exposure cube FITS file comprising three extensions.
The primary extension contains a 3-dimensional image that contains the 
exposure values. The next extension named ``ENERGIES`` contains a binary table
that defines the energies of the exposure cube. The last extension named ``GTI``
contains a binary table that provides the Good Time Intervals of all
observations that have been used for the computation of the exposure cube.

Standard parameters
-------------------

``(publish = no) [boolean]``
    Specifies whether the exposure cube should be published on VO Hub.

``(chatter = 2) [integer]``
    Verbosity of the executable:
     ``chatter = 0``: no information will be logged
