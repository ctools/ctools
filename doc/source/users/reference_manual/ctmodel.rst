Generate model cube.


Synopsis
--------

This tool generates a model cube based on an input model. A model cube is
a 3-dimensional cube providing the number of predicted counts for a model as 
function of Right Ascension or Galactic longitude, Declination or Galactic
latitude, and energy. The energy binning may be either linear, logarithmic,
or custom defined using an input file.

ctmodel requires on input either a counts cube, an event list or an observation
definition file.

If a counts cube is provided, ctmodel will use the definition of this cube
(such as sky coordinates and projection, number of pixels, pixel scale,
energy binning) to compute a model cube. In case that the counts cube combines
multiple observations (i.e. for a so-called "stacked cube"), an exposure cube,
a point spread function cube and a background cube have to be provided
(otherwise you may just enter ``NONE`` when the names of these files are
queried).

If an event list is provided, ctmodel will query for a counts cube to 
extract the model cube definition (parameter ``incube``). If no counts cube
is  provided (``incube=NONE``), ctmodel tools will query for cube definition
parameters.

If an observation definition file is provided, ctmodel will query for a counts
cube to extract the model cube definition, unless the observation definition
file contains a single binned observation (in that case, the counts cube of
that observation will be used to extract the model cube definition).

ctmodel generates a model cube FITS file comprising three extensions. The
primary extension contains a 3-dimensional image that contains the model 
cube values. The next extension named ``EBOUNDS`` contains a binary table
that defines the energy boundaries of the background cube. The last extension
named ``GTI`` contains a binary table that defines the Good Time Intervals
that are covered by the model cube.
