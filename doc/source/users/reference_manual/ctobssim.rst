========

Simulate event list(s).


Synopsis
--------

This tool simulates event list(s) using the instrument characteristics 
specified by the instrument response function(s) and an input model. The 
simulation includes photon events from astrophysical sources and background
events from an instrumental background model.

By default, ctobssim creates a single event list. ctobssim queries a pointing
direction, the radius of the simulation region, a time interval, an energy
interval, an instrumental response function, and an input model. ctobssim uses
a numerical random number generator for the simulations with a seed value
provided by the hidden ``seed`` parameter. Changing this parameter for
subsequent runs will lead to different event samples.

ctobssim performs a safety check on the maximum photon rate for all model 
components to avoid that the tool locks up and requests huge memory 
resources, which may happen if a mistake was made in setting up the input 
model (for example if an error in the flux units is made). The maximum allowed
photon rate is controlled by the hidden ``maxrate`` parameter, which by default 
is set to 1e6.

ctobssim can also generate multiple event lists if an observation definition 
file is specified on input using the hidden ``inobs`` parameter. In that 
case, simulation information will be gathered from the file, and for each 
observation an event list will be created.

For each event file, the simulation parameters will be written as data
selection keywords to the FITS header. These keywords are mandatory for any
unbinned maximum likelihood analysis of the event data.


General parameters
------------------

``inobs [file]``
    Input event list or observation definition XML file. If provided (i.e. the
    parameter is not blank or NONE), the pointing definition and eventually the
    response information will be extracted from the input file for event
    simulation.

``inmodel [file]``
    Input model XML file.
 	 	 
``caldb [string]``
    Calibration database.
 	 	 
``irf [string]``
    Instrumental response function.
 	 	 
``(edisp = no) [boolean]``
    Apply energy dispersion?
 	 	 
``outevents [file]``
    Output event list or observation definition XML file.
 	 	 
``(prefix = sim_events_) [string]``
    Prefix for event list in observation definition XML file.

``(startindex = 1) [integer]``
    Start index of event list in observation definition XML file.

``(seed = 1) [integer]``
    Integer seed value to be used for Monte Carlo simulations. Keep this 
    parameter at the same value for repeatable simulations, or increment 
    this value for subsequent runs if non-repeatable simulations are
    required.
 	 	 
``ra [real]``
    Right Ascension of CTA pointing (J2000, in degrees).
 	 	 
``dec [real]``
    Declination of CTA pointing (J2000, in degrees).
 	 	 
``rad [real]``
    Radius of CTA field of view (simulation cone radius) (in degrees).
 	 	 
``tmin [time]``
    Start time (UTC string, JD, MJD or MET in seconds).
 	 	 
``tmax [time]``
    Stop time (UTC string, JD, MJD or MET in seconds).

``emin [real]``
    Lower energy limit of simulated events (in TeV).
 	 	 
``emax [real]``
    Upper energy limit of simulated events (in TeV).
 	 	 
``(deadc = 0.95) [real]``
    Average deadtime correction factor.

``(maxrate = 1.0e6) [real]``
    Maximum photon rate for source models. Source models that exceed this
    maximum photon rate will lead to an exception as very likely the
    specified model normalisation is too large (probably due to the
    a misinterpretation of units). Note that ctools specifies intensity
    units per MeV.


Standard parameters
-------------------

``(publish = no) [boolean]``
    Specifies whether the event list(s) should be published on VO Hub.

``(chatter = 2) [integer]``
    Verbosity of the executable:
     ``chatter = 0``: no information will be logged
     
     ``chatter = 1``: only errors will be logged
     
     ``chatter = 2``: errors and actions will be logged
     
     ``chatter = 3``: report about the task execution
     
     ``chatter = 4``: detailed report about the task execution
 	 	 
``(clobber = yes) [boolean]``
    Specifies whether existing files should be overwritten.
 	 	 
``(debug = no) [boolean]``
    Enables debug mode. In debug mode the executable will dump any log file output to the console.
 	 	 
``(mode = ql) [string]``
    Mode of automatic parameters (default is "ql", i.e. "query and learn").

``(logfile = ctobssim.log) [string]``
    Name of log file.
