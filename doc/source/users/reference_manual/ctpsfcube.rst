Generate point spread function cube for a stacked analysis.


Synopsis
--------

This tool generates a point spread function cube for a stacked analysis.
A point spread function cube is a 4-dimensional cube spanned by Right
Ascension or Galactic longitude, Declination or Galactic latitude, energy,
and offset angle between true and measured arrival direction of a photon.
The energy binning of the cube may be either linear, logarithmic, or custom
defined using an input file.

ctpsfcube requires on input the event list or observation definition XML
file that has been used in the generation of the counts cube using :doc:`ctbin`.

It is not recommended to use the counts cube for the point spread function 
cube definition, although this is formally possible by specifying the counts 
cube as ``incube`` parameter. This leads however to a large FITS file on 
output since the number of bins in the counts cube will be multiplied by 
the number of offset angle bins (typically 200). Since the point spread 
function varies only slowly over the field of view of the camera it is 
recommended to use a rather coarse spatial binning to keep the file size 
manageable (with a typical value of ``binsz=1.0``).

ctpsfcube generates a point spread function cube FITS file comprising three
extensions. The primary extension contains a 4-dimensional image that contains
the point spread function values. The next extension named ``ENERGIES`` contains
a binary table that defines the energies of the point spread function cube.
The last extension named ``DELTAS`` contains a binary table that defines the
offset angles between true and measured arrival direction of the photon.
