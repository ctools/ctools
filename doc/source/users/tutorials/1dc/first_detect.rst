Detecting candidate sources
---------------------------

As next step you need to identify the location of candidate sources in the
sky map.
You do this using the :ref:`cssrcdetect` script:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cssrcdetect
   Input sky map file [skymap.fits] skymap_bkgsubtract.fits
   Source model type (POINT) [POINT]
   Background model type (NONE|IRF|AEFF|CUBE) [NONE] IRF
   Detection threshold (Gaussian sigma) [5.0] 10.0
   Output model definition XML file [models.xml]
   Output DS9 region file [ds9.reg]

This generates a
:ref:`model definition file <glossary_moddef>` ``models.xml``
that contains point source model components for all sources that were
detected in the sky map.
All model components have a power law as spectral component with
parameters that correspond to 1% of the very-high-energy spectrum of the
Crab, which is a reasonable starting condition for a subsequent model
fitting using the :ref:`ctlike` tool.
To detect the sources, :ref:`cssrcdetect` employs a peak finding algorithm that
iteratively finds all peaks in the sky map above a given threshold.
The detection threshold was set here to ``10.0`` which means that only peaks
are considered that are ten standard deviations above the mean value of the
sky map pixels.

The script generated also a `ds9 <http://ds9.si.edu>`_ region file that can
be overlaid on the sky map.
Due to the relatively high threshold of ten standard deviations, only two
sources were detected.

Below is the content of the
:ref:`model definition XML file <glossary_moddef>`
that was generated by :ref:`cssrcdetect`.
There are three model components in the file and each model component is
identified using a unique ``name`` attribute.
The first two components, ``"Src001"`` and ``"Src002"``, are the two point sources
detected by :ref:`cssrcdetect`, the third component, ``"Background"``, is a
background model component of type ``"CTAIrfBackground"``.
The latter component was added because the background model type was set to
``IRF`` in the :ref:`cssrcdetect` run.
Having a background model component added allows to directly use the
:ref:`model definition XML file <glossary_moddef>`
for a model fitting with :ref:`ctlike`.
