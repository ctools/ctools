Scope of the first CTA Data Challenge
=====================================

The goal of the
:ref:`first CTA Data Challenge <glossary_1dc>`
is to enable the CTA Consortium Science Working Groups to derive **science
benchmarks** for the CTA Key Science Projects.

The
:ref:`first CTA Data Challenge <glossary_1dc>`
should provide **quantitative estimates** of CTA's science capabilities that
will enable the CTA Consortium Science Working Groups to evaluate science
trade-offs in the future.
The
:ref:`first CTA Data Challenge <glossary_1dc>`
should also result in numerous **show cases**, including for example images,
spectra and light curves, that can be used to illustrate CTA's science case,
and that should enrich the CTA outreach material.
And the
:ref:`first CTA Data Challenge <glossary_1dc>`
should also stimulate the **enrichment of the CTA Science Case**.

The data distributed in the
:ref:`first CTA Data Challenge <glossary_1dc>`
are high-level data in form of
:ref:`event lists <glossary_eventlist>`
and
:ref:`instrument response functions <glossary_irf>`
(data level 3).
The
:ref:`event lists <glossary_eventlist>`
were simulated from high-level
:ref:`instrument response functions <glossary_irf>`
that correspond to an ideal CTA with good and stable atmosphere and instrument
conditions; only zenith angles of 20 degrees and 40 degrees were
simulated.
Data are provided for the baseline arrays.

Four Key Science Projects (KSPs) were simulated using realistic pointing
patterns as defined in the CTA Science Case document:

* the Galactic Plane Scan (GPS)
* the Galactic Centre Survey (GC)
* the Extragalactic Survey (EGAL)
* an AGN monitoring program (AGN)

The source model used for the simulations is distributed together with the
data to the CTA Consortium Science Working Groups, so that analysis results
can be compared to the Monte Carlo truth. The same source model was used for
all simulations.
