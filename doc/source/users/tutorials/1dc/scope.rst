Scope of the first CTA Data Challenge
=====================================

The :ref:`first CTA Data Challenge <glossary_1dc>` was focused on the
validation of the CTA Science Tools and had the following goals:

* enlarge the number of collaborators analysing data within CTA
* prepare for the analysis of real CTA data
* validate current data formats and see if information or specifications are
  missing
* validate features and completeness of science tools packages
* push the development of new algorithms
* ensure the compatibility of CTA data with multiple tools and the external
  scientific world

The data that were distributed in the
:ref:`first CTA Data Challenge <glossary_1dc>`
were high-level data in form of
:ref:`event lists <glossary_eventlist>`
and
:ref:`instrument response functions <glossary_irf>`
(data level 3).
The
:ref:`event lists <glossary_eventlist>`
were simulated from high-level
:ref:`instrument response functions <glossary_irf>`
that corresponded to an ideal CTA with good and stable atmosphere and
instrument conditions.
Only zenith angles of 20 degrees and 40 degrees were simulated.
Data were provided for the CTA baseline arrays.

Four Key Science Projects (KSPs) were simulated using realistic pointing
patterns as defined in the
`Science with the Cherenkov Telescope Array <https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/10986>`_
book:

* the Galactic Plane Scan (GPS)
* the Galactic Centre Survey (GC)
* the Extragalactic Survey (EGAL)
* an AGN monitoring program (AGN)

The source model used for the simulations was distributed together with the
data to the CTA Consortium Science Working Groups, so that analysis results
could be compared to the Monte Carlo truth. The same source model was used for
all simulations.
