==================================

This tutorial is specifically written for the analysis of H.E.S.S. data but
it may also be applicable to VERITAS and MAGIC, provided that these instruments
set up a data store that is compliant with the format described in
`Data formats for gamma-ray astronomy <http://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.org/en/latest/data_storage/index.html>`_.
