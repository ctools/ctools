Doing an On/Off analysis
--------------------------

  .. admonition:: What you will learn

     You will learn how to **adjust a parametrised spectral model to
     the events deriving the bacground from the data**.

     Gamma-ray events are rare compared to the background events,
     hence small imperfections of the background model can have a
     large impact on the estimated source parameters.

     In classical IACT analyses the background has been normally
     derived from the data, by defining On (source) and Off
     (background) regions. An On/Off analysis is recommended if you
     want to assure minimal dependency on the Monte Carlo background model.
