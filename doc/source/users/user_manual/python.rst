Using ctools from Python
------------------------

Getting started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ctools provides a Python module that allows using all tools and scripts as 
Python classes.
To use ctools from Python all you have to do is to import the ctools 
module into Python.
You should also import the GammaLib module, as ctools without GammaLib is 
generally not very useful.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import gammalib
   >>> import ctools

To illustrate how to use ctools from Python, below is a working example 
of an event list simulation using the :ref:`ctobssim` class.
An instance ``sim`` of the :ref:`ctobssim` class is generated and user 
parameters are set for this instance using the ``[ ]`` operator.
See the :ref:`reference` for a list of parameters and their types.
The ``execute()`` method executes the :ref:`ctobssim` class in the same 
way as if it were executed from the command line.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import ctools
   >>> sim = ctools.ctobssim()
   >>> sim["inmodel"] = "${CTOOLS}/share/models/crab.xml"
   >>> sim["outevents"] = "events.fits"
   >>> sim["caldb"] = "prod2"
   >>> sim["irf"] = "South_0.5h"
   >>> sim["ra"] = 83.63
   >>> sim["dec"] = 22.01
   >>> sim["rad"] = 5.0
   >>> sim["tmin"] = 0.0
   >>> sim["tmax"] = 1800.0
   >>> sim["emin"] = 0.1
   >>> sim["emax"] = 100.0
   >>> sim.execute()

Alternatively, you may "run" the :ref:`ctobssim` tool using

.. code-block:: python

   >>> sim.run()

The main difference to the ``execute()`` method is that the ``run()`` 
will not write the simulated event file to disk.
Why is this useful?
Well, after having typed ``sim.run()`` the :ref:`ctobssim` class still 
exists as an object in memory, including all the simulated events.
The :ref:`ctobssim` class has an ``obs()`` method that returns an 
observation container that holds the simulated CTA observation with its 
associated events.
To visualise this container, type:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> print(sim.obs())
   === GObservations ===
    Number of observations ....: 1
    Number of models ..........: 2
    Number of observed events .: 23099
    Number of predicted events : 0

There is one CTA observation in the container and to visualise the events 
in that observation you may type:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> print(sim.obs()[0].events())
   === GCTAEventList ===
    Number of events ..........: 23099 (disposed in "events.fits")
    Time interval .............: 51544.5 - 51544.5 days
   === GEbounds ===
    Number of intervals .......: 1
    Energy range ..............: 100 GeV - 100 TeV
   === GCTARoi ===
    ROI centre ................: RA=83.63, DEC=22.01 [0,0]
    ROI radius ................: 5 deg

The ``obs()[0]`` operator returns the first observation in the observation 
container, the ``events()`` operator returns the event list in that 
observation.
To see what kind of object you actually got, use:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> type(sim.obs()[0].events())
   <class 'gammalib.cta.GCTAEventList'>

The CTA event list is implement by the ``GCTAEventList`` class in the 
``cta`` module of GammaLib.
To visualise the individual events you can iterate over the events using a 
for loop.
This will show the simulated celestial coordinates (RA, DEC), the 
coordinate in the camera system [DETX, DETY], energies and 
terrestrial times (TT) of all events. 

.. code-block:: python

   >>> events = sim.obs()[0].events()
   >>> for event in events:
   ...     print(event)
   ...
   Dir=RA=83.6308, DEC=21.8881 [-0.00212759,1.33661e-05] Energy=106.465 GeV Time=-3.15576e+08 s (TT)
   Dir=RA=83.7518, DEC=21.8064 [-0.0035525,0.00197398] Energy=117.706 GeV Time=-3.15576e+08 s (TT)
   Dir=RA=83.5545, DEC=22.0933 [0.00145377,-0.00122121] Energy=138.624 GeV Time=-3.15576e+08 s (TT)
   ...


Performing a maximum likelihood analysis in Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can now benefit from the fact that we have some simulated events in 
memory to fit a model to these events using the :ref:`ctlike` class.
We will do this in unbinned mode.
Here is what you have to do:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> like = ctools.ctlike(sim.obs())
   >>> like.run()

This is pretty compact.
Where are the user parameters?
:ref:`ctlike` doesn't in fact need any as all the relevant information is 
already contained in the observation container produced by the 
:ref:`ctobssim` class.
And you may have recognised that we constructed the :ref:`ctlike` 
instance by using the :ref:`ctobssim` observation container as
constructor argument.

To check how the fit went you can inspect the optimiser used by
:ref:`ctlike`:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> print(like.opt())         
   === GOptimizerLM ===
    Optimized function value ..: 154553.422
    Absolute precision ........: 0.005
    Acceptable value decrease .: 2
    Optimization status .......: converged
    Number of parameters ......: 10
    Number of free parameters .: 4
    Number of iterations ......: 2
    Lambda ....................: 1e-05

Apparently, the fit converged after 2 iterations.
Out of 10 parameters in the model 4 have been fitted (the others were kept
fixed).
To inspect the fit results you can print the model container that is a 
member of the observation container:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> print(like.obs().models())
   === GModels ===
    Number of models ..........: 2
    Number of parameters ......: 10
   === GModelSky ===
    Name ......................: Crab
    Instruments ...............: all
    Instrument scale factors ..: unity
    Observation identifiers ...: all
    Model type ................: PointSource
    Model components ..........: "PointSource" * "PowerLaw" * "Constant"
    Number of parameters ......: 6
    Number of spatial par's ...: 2
     RA .......................: 83.6331 [-360,360] deg (fixed,scale=1)
     DEC ......................: 22.0145 [-90,90] deg (fixed,scale=1)
    Number of spectral par's ..: 3
     Prefactor ................: 5.82698e-16 +/- 1.02186e-17 [1e-23,1e-13] ph/cm2/s/MeV (free,scale=1e-16,gradient)
     Index ....................: -2.47534 +/- 0.0154764 [-0,-5]  (free,scale=-1,gradient)
     PivotEnergy ..............: 300000 [10000,1e+09] MeV (fixed,scale=1e+06,gradient)
    Number of temporal par's ..: 1
     Normalization ............: 1 (relative value) (fixed,scale=1,gradient)
   === GCTAModelIrfBackground ===
    Name ......................: CTABackgroundModel
    Instruments ...............: CTA
    Instrument scale factors ..: unity
    Observation identifiers ...: all
    Model type ................: "PowerLaw" * "Constant"
    Number of parameters ......: 4
    Number of spectral par's ..: 3
     Prefactor ................: 1.01266 +/- 0.0119676 [0.001,1000] ph/cm2/s/MeV (free,scale=1,gradient)
     Index ....................: 0.00474762 +/- 0.00731725 [-5,5]  (free,scale=1,gradient)
     PivotEnergy ..............: 1e+06 [10000,1e+09] MeV (fixed,scale=1e+06,gradient)
    Number of temporal par's ..: 1
     Normalization ............: 1 (relative value) (fixed,scale=1,gradient)

Suppose you want to repeat the fit by optimising also the position of the 
point source.
This is easy from Python:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> like.obs().models()["Crab"]["RA"].free()
   >>> like.obs().models()["Crab"]["DEC"].free()
   >>> like.run()
   >>> print(like.obs().models())
   ...
     RA .......................: 83.6327 +/- 0.000916983 [-360,360] deg (free,scale=1)
     DEC ......................: 22.0141 +/- 0.00086378 [-90,90] deg (free,scale=1)

The ``like.obs().models()`` method provides the model container, using the 
``["Crab"]`` operator we access the Crab model in that container and using 
the ``["RA"]`` and ``["DEC"]`` methods we access the relevant model 
parameters.
The ``free()`` method frees a parameter, the opposite would be a call to 
the ``fix()`` method.

.. warning::

   Passing observation containers between ctools classes is a very 
   convenient and powerful way of building in-memory analysis pipelines.
   However, this implies that you need some computing ressources when 
   dealing with large observation containers (for example if you want to 
   analyse a few 100 hours of data at once).

.. warning::

   You have to be aware about the scope of the objects you're 
   dealing with.
   In the above example, the ``sim.obs()`` container is allocated by the
   :ref:`ctobssim` class, hence it disappears (a.k.a. goes out of scope)
   once the :ref:`ctobssim` class is deleted, as illustrated by the 
   following example:

   .. code-block:: python

      >>> obs = sim.obs()
      >>> del sim
      >>> print(obs)
      Segmentation fault

   Note that

   .. code-block:: python

      >>> obs = sim.obs()
      >>> del sim
      >>> print(like.obs())
      === GObservations ===
       Number of observations ....: 1
       Number of models ..........: 2
       Number of observed events .: 23099
       Number of predicted events : 23099

   is okay as the ``ctools.ctlike(sim.obs())`` constructor will create
   a copy of the observation container that lives within the :ref:`ctlike`
   instance.
   To preserve an observation container after a ctools object goes out 
   of scope you have to create a local copy of the container using the
   ``copy()`` method:

   .. code-block:: python

      >>> obs = sim.obs().copy()
      >>> del sim
      >>> print(obs)
      === GObservations ===
       Number of observations ....: 1
       Number of models ..........: 2
       Number of observed events .: 23099
       Number of predicted events : 0


Using obsutils
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ctools provides the Python module ``obsutils`` that may further simplify 
your analysis efforts.
``obsutils`` is a Python script that makes use of the GammaLib and ctools 
modules to create standard analysis steps.
As all Python scripts, ``obsutils`` is part of the cscripts module that
is imported using

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import cscripts

Here an example of how to use ``obsutils``:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import gammalib
   >>> import ctools
   >>> from cscripts import obsutils
   >>> pattern = obsutils.set_obs_patterns("four", ra=83.63, dec=22.01, offset=1.0)
   >>> obs = obsutils.set_obs_list(pattern, duration=1800, emin=0.1, emax=100.0, rad=5.0, caldb="prod2", irf="South_0.5h")
   >>> print(obs)   
   === GObservations ===
    Number of observations ....: 4
    Number of models ..........: 0
    Number of observed events .: 0
    Number of predicted events : 0
   >>> obs.models(gammalib.GModels("${CTOOLS}/share/models/crab.xml"))
   >>> obs = obsutils.sim(obs)
   >>> like = ctools.ctlike(obs)
   >>> like.run()
   >>> print(like.obs().models())
   === GModels ===
    Number of models ..........: 2
    Number of parameters ......: 10
   ...

The module is imported using the ``from cscripts import obsutils`` directive.
The ``obsutils.set_obs_patterns()`` function will create a pointing 
pattern of four observations located at offset angles of 1 degree from the 
nominal location of the Crab nebula.
The ``obsutils.set_obs_list()`` will build an observation container from 
that pattern where each pointing will have a duration of 1800 seconds, 
cover the 0.1-100 TeV energy range and a field of view of 5°.
The ``South_0.5h`` IRF from the Prod2 calibration database will be used.
A model is then appended to the observation container using the
``obs.models()`` method.
The ``obsutils.sim()`` function then simulates the event data and returns
an observation container with the simulated observations.
The observation container is then passed to ``ctlike`` for maximum likelihood
fitting.


Access analysis results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some examples that show how to access your analysis results in
python.
In the following it is assumed that you have a ctlike object called 
``like`` which is setup and runs:

.. code-block:: python
   
   import gammalib
   import ctools
   like = ctools.ctlike(sim.obs())
   like.run()

* Best-fit parameters:

  The following command shows how to access the fit parameters and errors:
  
  .. code-block:: python

    obs = like.obs() # Get observations object
    obs.models()["Crab"]["Prefactor"].value() # This returns the actual fit value
    obs.models()["Crab"]["Prefactor"].error() # This returns the actual fit error

* Open XML model file from python and print models on screen:

  .. code-block:: python
  
    models = gammalib.GModels("$CTOOLS/share/models/crab.xml")
    print(models)

* Likelihood value
 
  .. code-block:: python
  
    logL = like.opt().value() # Returns log-likelihood value
    print(logL)

  or alternatively

  .. code-block:: python
  
    logL = like.obs().function().value() # Returns log-likelihood value
    print(logL)

* Curvature Matrix (aka Hessian)

  .. code-block:: python
   
    curvature = like.obs().function().curvature() # Return GMatrixSparse object
    print(curvature)

  To get the covariance matrix, the curvature matrix needs to be
  inverted:

  .. code-block:: python

    covariance = curvature.invert()
    print(covariance)


Modify and work on XML models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix a certain parameter
	
 .. code-block:: python

   models["Crab"]["Prefactor"].fix()

* Release a certain parameter

 .. code-block:: python

   models["Crab"]["Prefactor"].free()

* Check if parameter is free

 .. code-block:: python

   if models["Crab"]["Prefactor"].is_free():
       ...

* Set parameter value

 .. code-block:: python

   models["Crab"]["Index"].value(-2.5)

* Set parameter boundaries

 .. code-block:: python 
   
   models["Crab"]["Index"].min(-5.0)
   models["Crab"]["Index"].max(-1.0)

 or quicker

 .. code-block:: python 
   
   models["Crab"]["Index"].range(-5.0,-1.0)

* Loop over models and parameters (e.g. fix all parameters)

 .. code-block:: python

    for model in models: # Loop over models
        for par in model: # Loop over parameters
            par.fix() # fix parameter

* Save modified XML model
 
 .. code-block:: python
   
   models.save("my_model.xml")


Beyond the first steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You now have learned the basics of using ctools and GammaLib within Python.
To go beyond these initial steps you may check the Python scripts in the
``examples`` folder that provide useful analysis examples.
Check the ``README.md`` file in that folder for an explanation of the scripts.
